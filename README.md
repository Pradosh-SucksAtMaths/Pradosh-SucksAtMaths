- 👋 Hi, I’m Pradosh
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Mathematics and Used to help out my collegues in some stuff related to maths.
- As in secondary classes I had Qualified for Some Olympiad things so I got my main interest in maths especially in Calculus Stuffs 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bachelors of Mathematics alongside with subjects Physics and Statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Nothing as of now as I'm not that good in GitHub.
- 📫 you Can reach to me via gmail at pradosh2k@gmail.com
